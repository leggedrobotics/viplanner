# Definition of which crosswalks should be repeated how often along which axis
# Adjusted for: TOWN02

# each entry has the following format:
# name:
#   cw_prim:      [str]           prim of the crosswalk in the loaded town file
#   factor:       [int]           number how often the crosswalk should be repeated
#   translation:  [float, float]  vector along which the crosswalk should be repeated, defines the position of the first
#                                 repeated crosswalk, every following crosswalk will be placed at the position of the
#                                 previous one plus the translation vector
#   suffix:       [str]           optional, str will be added to the copied prim of the new crosswalk

# NOTE: rotations and scales applied to the mesh are not applied to the translations given here, i.e. they have to be
#       in the original dataformat of the town file, i.e. y-up and in cm
