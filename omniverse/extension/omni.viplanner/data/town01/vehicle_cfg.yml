# Definition of where additional vehicles should be added
# Adjusted for: TOWN01

# each entry has the following format:
# name:
#   prim_part:    [str]                         part of the prim of the vehicle that should be multiplied (every prim containing this string will be multiplied)
#   translation:  [[float, float, float]]       list of translations of the vehicle

# NOTE: rotations and scales applied to the mesh are not applied to the translations given here, i.e. they have to be
#       in the original dataformat of the town file, i.e. y-up and in cm

# NOTE: for Town01, take "ChevroletImpala_High_V4" for vehicles along the x axis and "JeepWranglerRubicon_36"
#       for vehicles along the y axis
